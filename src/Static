When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object.

Use the static variable for the property that is common to all objects.
For example, in class Student, all students shares the same college name. Use static methods for changing static variables.

Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

They can only directly call other static methods.
They can only directly access static data.
They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
