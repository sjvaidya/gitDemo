Local variables (Inside class methods):
Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.
The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.

Instance variables: (Inside class, Outside Methods)
Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method.
These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. 
Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.

Class variables
Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.

Difference between instance variable and class variable also known as non-static vs static variable in java.
Instance variables are per instance (object) basis.
If you have 5 instances of one class you will have five copies of an instance variable.
These are also referred as non-static variable and initialized when you create instance of any object using new() operator or
by using other methods like reflection e.g. Class.newInstance().

On the other hand, Class variables are declared using static keyword and they have exact same value for every instance. 
static or class variable are initialized when the class is first loaded into JVM memory, unlike instance variable which initialized when an instance is created.
