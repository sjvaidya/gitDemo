MyClass obj = new MyClass()
#classname #objectname = new #classconstructor
The new keyword here creates the object of class MyClass and invokes the constructor to initialize this newly created object.

Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).
Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.
All classes have constructors by default:
if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. 
However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

Default constructor in Java initializes member data variable to default values
(numeric values are initialized as 0, booleans are initialized as false and references are initialized as null).

And if we write a constructor with arguments or no-arguments then the compiler does not create a default constructor. So

You cannot parameterized constructor without using default constructor else
